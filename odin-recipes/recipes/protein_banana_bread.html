    <p>A banana bread recipe that is packed with protein. Trying to live that healthy life #bodyIsATemple</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cup white, spelt, or oat flour (or try this Almond Flour Banana Bread)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup protein powder (60g)</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup mashed overripe banana</li>
        <li>1/2 cup yogurt or additional banana</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pure maple syrup, honey, or agave</li>
        <li>1/3 cup oil or water</li>
        <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>optional chocolate chips, walnuts, coconut, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Grease a 9Ã—5 loaf pan, and line the bottom with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F. </li>
        <li>Stir all ingredients together, smooth the batter into the pan, and bake 40 minutes. </li>
        <li>Turn the oven off, but do not open the door even a crack. </li>
        <li>Leave the protein banana bread in the closed oven for an additional five minutes. Mine is always done after
            this time. </li>
        <li>If yours is still soft in the center for some reason (climate, uncalibrated oven, etc.), cover the top with
            tin foil and continue baking until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean. </li>
        <li>Let cool, then go around the sides with a knife and invert onto a plate. </li>
        <li>If you can wait, the taste and texture are even better the next day!</li>
    </ol>
